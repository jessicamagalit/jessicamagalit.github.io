Hi everyone, my name is Jessie Magalit and I am from Chicago, IL. I am currently double majoring in Ecosystem Science & Sustainability and Apparel Design & Production. Some of my favorite past times include thrifting, sewing, up-cycling, cooking/baking, and going to art museums. I look forward to displaying my academic accomplishments on this website that I created myself using code!
